# Shawn and Partners CRM - Leandro Zanardo Fullstack Developer Test

Welcome to the Shawn and Partners CRM Fullstack Developer test project!

This project serves as a test for fullstack developers applying to Shawn and Partners. It's designed to showcase your skills in building a fullstack application involving both frontend and backend components.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a GitHub user listing application. It fetches GitHub user data using the GitHub API and displays user details along with their repositories. The project is divided into two main components:

1. Backend: The backend is built with Node.js and Express, serving as a proxy for the GitHub API. It provides endpoints to fetch user data and repositories.

2. Frontend: The frontend is built using React with TypeScript. It displays user details and repositories fetched from the backend.

#### Special thanks
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this test. I've been working with web development for several years, but I still haven't had the opportunity to work with NodeJS or React JS using typescript. It was quite challenging but a lot of fun, I love learning new technologies and creating interesting projects.
I know I still have little experience with this stack but it's the one I'd like to work with and I just need an opportunity, you'll see in my test that I'm fully capable.
I hope you like my project and if possible to be part of the team soon.
Have a great day!
